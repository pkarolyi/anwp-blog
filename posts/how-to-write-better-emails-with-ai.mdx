We all write emails. And we receive a lot of them. Over 360 billion emails are sent every year. With those numbers, it’s clear that getting your email right is more important than ever.

So why not let AI do the heavy lifting for you? Writing a solid email with AI is shockingly easy. Here’s how you can do it:

 - **Think it through.** Why are you sending this email?
 - **Write bullets.** Write down the main things you need to communicate.
 - **Open your AI tool.** Open ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever else you prefer.
 - **Give it a prompt.** Ask the AI to help you draft an email using your notes.
 - **Don't waste other people's time.** Just put the original bullet points into the email. Add a greeting and you are done with a nice, information dense email.

Boom. You just saved someone from having to wade through a vague, meandering, multi-paragraph mess of an email that would have taken them 10 minutes to understand. Or yeah, of course they could've just summarized it with AI. But what is the point then?
